# KSP-IPH-2019-Table08
Karnataka State Police Hackathon Finals

## Topic - MoRTH Data Analytics

### Deliverables :

- Descriptive Statistics
- Business Intelligence
- Predictive Modeling, Pattern Recognition
- Inferential Stats
- Creation / Customization of Dashboards

### Systematic Approaches Employed :

- Used Road Accidents and Vehicle data, Hospital and Victim data to form a concise stat representation.
- Modeled and collated multiple DBs, preprocessed and used Statistical Learning metrics for Analysis. 
- Employed Subset Maximization algorithm for params with confidence thresholds to get most probable factors for accidents.
- Augmentation through real time data and with previously learned clusters using KNN and previously used confidence params
- React for the webpage/dashboard design, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations : plots, graphs, etc.

### Data Selection :

- Multiple data columns were dump data from db, or empty tuples, and hence were either dropped or pruned
- Collated databases to get redundant columns, hence removed them
- Correlation plots after normalization to understand interplay of features, selected params above a set threshold
- Highly correlated data was delved into and yielded accident related results, and hence formed the basis of our solution

### Data Modeling :

- Used normalization, preprocessing, outlier detection, standardization, and transformation for numerical data
- Used label encoding, processing, and label correlation for categorical data
- Developed Deep Learning and Statistical modeling approaches for the deliverables

### Graphs :

- All points of interest were either directly related to vehicles or accident data, and hece were plotted as such
- Used Seaborn for pairplots, Matplotlib for graphs

### Dashboard :

- Used Weather API data for real time weather conditions, approach pending future data
- Hosted images and graphs generated via ReactJS
- Deployed Flask backend to support algorithms and solution built
